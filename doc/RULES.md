# Rules

Gim operates only with master branch of Git projects using latest tag's commit. If there is no tag, it uses latest commit.

A Git project is **gim ready** if gim's preferred commit can be installed and uninstalled using an installer stated in the [*INSTALLERS.md*](doc/INSTALLERS.md) file.

If a Git project needs advanced control, it respects a control policy stated in the [*CONTROL.md*](doc/CONTROL.md) file.
